      "This is because the process involves handling of sensitive electronic components connected to the seat like the power adjusters, heaters, cooling systems, seat belt connections and possibly even airbags in some models. Therefore, it's crucial to follow specific instructions for your car model to avoid any damage or triggering of a fault code in the vehicle systems. The process generally involves steps like disconnecting the battery, removing bolts securing the seat, disconnecting wiring harnesses etc. but the exact process can vary depending on the car model.\n",

      "- Power adjusters: These are the electronic systems that let you adjust the position of the seat at the push of a button, you might see a set of buttons or controls at the side of your seat.\n",
      "- Heaters & Cooling Systems: Some car seats are equipped with heaters and/or coolers to maintain the seat temperature according to your comfort; usually found in higher-end models.\n",
      "- Seat Belt Connections: These relate to where the seat belt is connected to the seat or car body. In some cars, the seat belt retraction mechanism can be integrated into the seat itself.\n",
      "- Airbags: Safety devices that inflate in an event of a crash to protect the passengers. In some cars, side airbags can be integrated into the seats.\n",
      "- Fault code: Error messages stored by the vehicle's computer system when it detects an issue or abnormal operation in any part of the vehicle. Removing the seat incorrectly can result in such fault codes.\n",
      "- Wiring Harness: A collection of wires that carry electrical signals and power to various parts of the car. Seats with electronic functions have a wiring harness that needs to be disconnected before removal.\n",
      "- Battery: Powers all the electrical components of the car. It's usually disconnected as a safety measure before beginning any repair or replacement work that involves electrical components.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Front Passenger Seat Back Rest Replacement Procedure:\n",
      "   1.1. Remove the front passenger seat assembly. This includes removing things like the seat back rest, lumbar support which is the adjustable part providing support to your lower back, plastic insulators which are for insulation purposes, headrest post guides referring to the frame in which headrest sits, and the recliner motor which is responsible for the automatic adjustment of the seat.\n",
      "   1.2. Make sure to follow the specified torque for the bolts and use the recommended tools for the job.\n",
